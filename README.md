### Hello ðŸ‘‹

---

I developed this clone app using React Native implementing frontend skills and backend
such as creating new users and adding them to the database, login with credentials, creating
posts, pulling posts to the feed from the database, and liking and commenting on posts.

ðŸ”¥ Firebase is used for storing the backend.
